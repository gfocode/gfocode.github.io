     <h1>Good Friends Only</h1>
     <hr class="solid">

     <p>"This group was made for the purpose of hmming, which holds severe importance and is critical to the survival of the ancient room called good friends only. A crown when placed next to the name brings about a flash of light and destroys the very fabric of harmony among the members of good friends only. Wild accusations immediately arise and it leads to a series of arguments which neither recovers the room nor does it give extra information regarding its location.This channel was made for the external members, people who may never be part of the great land of good friends only. These members get access to only a few channels. The bots have access to almost every channel. However, a certain bot called Dank Memer lost access to some channels due to excessive usage which resulted in the main channels getting completely spammed and caused enormous lag on the server. This server is associated with several other servers, including- good friends only (smaller version) and the SMP, among others."<br> ~ Unknown, 3rd February 2021</p>

        <h3> The Greatness of Each of the Members</h3>
        <ul> 
          <li> The person who designed this website, are of course, without a shred of doubt, the greatest member of GFO. </li> 
          <li>The initial design was made by the another less great person (Mind you, that person is great too, but not as great). </li> 
          <li>  The third person was a spectator to the site and is a fan of a thing called privacy.</li> 
          <li>His greatness has not been measured yet and so is unknown.</li> 
          <li> Others also watched. Their greatness has also not been measured yet and thus their greatness is unknown. However, one thing is certain. The person mentioned first in this paragraph is surely the greatest. </li>
