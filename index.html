     <h1>Good Friends Only</h1>
        <hr class="solid">
     <p>"This group was made for the purpose of hmming, which holds severe importance and is critical to the survival of the ancient room called good friends only. A crown when placed next to the name brings about a flash of light and destroys the very fabric of harmony among the members of good friends only. Wild accusations immediately arise and it leads to a series of arguments which neither recovers the room nor does it give extra information regarding its location.This channel was made for the external members, people who may never be part of the great land of good friends only. These members get access to only a few channels. The bots have access to almost every channel. However, a certain bot called Dank Memer lost access to some channels due to excessive usage which resulted in the main channels getting completely spammed and caused enormous lag on the server. This server is associated with several other servers, including- good friends only (smaller version) and the SMP, among others."<br> ~ Unknown, 3rd February 2021</p>
